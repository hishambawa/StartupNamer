# Startup Namer

A Flutter application that generates random names for startups, and allows users to save their favourite names.

The application was developed as a part of a Google Codelabs tutorial for Flutter, which is available [here.] (https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt1#0)

## Features

The application generates random names and lazy loads them in an infinity scroll view. More names will be generated and displayed as the user scrolls.
